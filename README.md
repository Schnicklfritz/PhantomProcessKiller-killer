# PhantomProcessKillers-Kilt
A noob friendly, step by step guide to
treating the symptoms of this process 
that limits all background processes to
32 total.  For regular android users, this 
is a good thing, as it improves battery life 
and lowers latency.  For Termux, linux, 
virtualization, net Hunter, and other 
resources intensive app users, it's a game 
changer for one simple reason.  Google didn't
add an off switch. Why would they treat customers
like this?  A sobering fact.  We are 
not the customer.  We...are the product.
I wasted a lot of time fixing this issue because
every tutorial I read, left something out, or 
wouldn't work.  I will attempt to include small
details that cost me time.  I hope this helps someone.
